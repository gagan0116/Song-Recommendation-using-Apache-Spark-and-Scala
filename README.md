# Song-Recommendation-using-Apache-Spark-and-Scala
An Apache Spark project to recommend songs to users based on their emotion in scala Programming language

#Abstract
This project focuses on Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System implemented in Apache Spark using Scala. Leveraging the power of unsupervised clustering and machine learning. The key objective is to categorize music into
distinct mood clusters based on important audio features like Energy, Valence, Danceability, and Loudness. Our approach combines Spark’s distributed processing capabilities with K-Means Clustering to group songs efficiently. It then employs the Random Forest classification algorithm, implemented in Scala, to associate users’ emotional states with these song clusters. The resulting system provides personalized and emotionally resonant music recommendations, thereby enhancing the user’s music listening experience. This project presents a novel approach to music recommendation, focusing on emotions rather than traditional genre or artist preferences, and showcases the scalability and efficiency of Apache Spark when handling large music datasets.
